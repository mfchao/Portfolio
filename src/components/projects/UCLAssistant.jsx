                                        According to surveys send across the student body, the current app is rarely used due to its inefficiency, difficult learnability, confusing navigation, unappealing design, awkward mapping, and confusing interfaces. Many students say that the idea of the app is great, but the current execution needs major improvement.

Through this research I learned that the most important aspects of a student's life are classes, homework or studying, and social or extracurricular events. Through this research I was able to start developing the app.
